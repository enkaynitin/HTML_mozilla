  <body>
    <p>This is my page</p>
   
    <p>I am a learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luthier">luthier</a>. I have built a Santos Hernandez. <p>
    <p>I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">Computer programming<a>. I like it when my box does what I tell it to do. Others are not able to tell it what it shall do, they like corporate ownership of their box, and they are constantly told to "think out of the box."</p>
    
    <p>Had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles Babbage<a/> seen present day computer users he would have regretted seeing them turning their whole life centred around the box instead of using it as a tool. </p>
    
    <p>I like playing guitar, keyboard. I have interest in musicology and linguistics. I want my box to perform certain task for me.</p>
